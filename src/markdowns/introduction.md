Technologist bred and fascinated by the web. Broad experience in **full stack development**, made the jump to **management** but still coding when there is the chance. Thrive in the **mix of technical and leadership roles**, looking at management from the problem solving perspective and striving to improve every day. Kept my tech skills up to date by *"scratching my own itch"* with some open-source projects.
